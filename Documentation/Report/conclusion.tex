\chapter{Conclusion}
We were able to create a wireless network of battery operated
devices which which would sense the occupancy of each
room and then relay the occupancy status to a central master
device. The device then relayed the real time occupancy status
to a local server. A web browser (client) can then dynamically,
using websockets, view the status of each node in real-time.
Future scope includes reducing the power consumption of
nodes by utilizing microcontroller sleep techniques when the
device is not transmitting.

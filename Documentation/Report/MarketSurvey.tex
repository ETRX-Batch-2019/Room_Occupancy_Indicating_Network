Workscape provides sensing devices similar to ours. It also provides meeting room booking and scheduling applications for mobile devices.
Workscape provides the booking and scheduling applications indepedantly or it also provides the applications along with the devices.
It also uses the data generated by the sensors to provide analytics on room occupancy status over a period of time.
The solutions offered by workscape are similar the ones proposed by us.

Workscape follows a subscricption pricing policy as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic: 8\textdollar per room per month which includes Calendar sync Room display app, Mobile App, Web booking, Reporting and analytics
\item Sensor: 15\textdollar per room per month which includes Everything in Basic + Smart sensors + Room automation + Enhanced reporting and analytics
\end{itemize}

The "Sensor`` solution costs 15\textdollar per room per month which would equal to 2700\textdollar for 15 rooms per year

Similar to workscape, occupeye can also moniter the occupancy status of a room. In addition occupeye is also intended to serve as a workstation occupancy monitoring sensor.
OccupEye is targeted towards improving the workspace utilization.
Like our proposed solution all the sensors transmit to a central receiving station which then pushes the data to the Internet. OccupEye analytics is web-based portal that can generate analytics on room/workspace utilization. This can help enable dynamic workspace allocation and serve to promote efficient workspace utilization.

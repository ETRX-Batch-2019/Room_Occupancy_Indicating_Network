\chapter{Next Steps}
\section{Testing with increased number of nodes}
Increasing the number of networked devices poses many challenges such as handling the require amount of connections, handling packet losses, planning deep sleep timings, etc and also may create some other unforeseen problems. This has to be tested and our next goal is to run 10 simultaneous devices (which we have available) and go further from there on.

\section{Mobile Application}
Current demonstration runs off a local server with the client (browser) based on the host machine itself. Since the webserver is based off Flask (Python), deploying it over the internet is easy and only requires some paid subscription for server hosting. After this, the same Web GUI will run on any smartphone browser or can even be integrated into a mobile application.      

\section{Implementation at Fractal Analytics}
Create a set of 10 physical sensors which can be implemented on the 7th floor in Fractal Analytics
Create a simple mobile app page - which will show the occupancy status of individual rooms on a smart phone
This will give us an invaluable experience of understanding what it takes to implement a project in a real life live environment

The objective of this action research based project was to tackle a problem faced by corporate environments. The typical corporate office consists of several meeting rooms with employees requiring frequent access to these meeting rooms, but lack of real-time knowledge of its availability leads to inconvenient hassle. The proposed solution consists of a network of motion detection sensors (namely, the PIR sensor) spread out across all meeting rooms, updating the room occupancy status in real-time to a central base-station, a desktop computer, from which it can be relayed to the employees using a web server or a smartphone application.

Each sensor node is designed to be Low Cost, Wireless and Low Power for seamless integration and to avoid frequent battery replacement.

This will lead to optimal utilization of the meeting rooms.

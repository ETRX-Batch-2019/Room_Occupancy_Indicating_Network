The objective of this action research based project was to tackle a problem faced by corporate environments. A typical corporate office consists of several meeting rooms with employees requiring frequent access to these meeting rooms, but lack of real-time knowledge of its occupancy leads to inconvenient hassle. The proposed solution consists of a network of motion detection sensors (namely, the PIR sensor) spread out across all meeting rooms, updating the room occupancy status in real-time to a central base-station. Employees using a web application or a smartphone can then check the occupancy of the rooms in real time

This will lead to optimal utilization of the meeting rooms.

Each sensor node is designed to be Low Cost, Wireless and Battery Powered for seamless integration and have Low Power Consumption and to avoid frequent battery replacement.

\begin{abstract}

If there was a real-time meeting room occupancy monitoring system then users could remotely check in real-time 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the room is occupied or not 
\item If a room is booked but not occupied
\item If a room is not booked and not occupied
\item The mobile app can use the data to cancel bookings if the room is unoccupied
\end{itemize}

This will lead to optimal utilization of the meeting rooms.
